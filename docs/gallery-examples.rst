Gallery of examples
===================

This gallery contains several application examples for the ``infovar`` package to illustrate diverse features.


**Discrete and continuous handler basic use:**

- ``discrete-handler.ipynb``: illustrate the basic features of `DiscreteHandler` on synthetic data
- ``continuous-handler.ipynb``: illustrate the basic features of `ContinuousHandler` on synthetic data

**California Housing real-world example:**

- ``californa-housing.ipynb``: most informative feature to predict house values in California

**Statistical details:**

- ``stat:bias-variance.ipynb``: controlling the bias and estimating the variance of canonical correlations and mutual information estimators
- ``stat:canonical-corr.ipynb``: canonical correlations and their relation to mutual information in detail
- ``stat:degeneracy.ipynb``: influence of duplicate data on estimators of differential conditional entropy and mutual information
- ``stat:distribution.ipynb``: influence of data distribution on conditional differential entropy, mutual information and canonical correlations
- ``stat:multidim.ipynb``: behavior and interpretation of mutual information for multidimensional variables or targets
- ``stat:ranking``: variable ranking in details
