# Information theory tools assessment

This directory contains notebooks illustrating the functioning and limitations of the information theory tools and estimators used in this project.

- `accuracy.ipynb`: investigates the accuracy and convergence of estimator for analytic distributions.
- `nonlinearity.ipynb`: investigates the behavior of the mutual information and conditional entropy estimators for arbitrary nonlinear relations.
- `degeneracy.ipynb`: investigates the influence of the degeneracy on non-parametric estimators and the optimal noise dynamics for correcting this behavior.
- `bootstrap.ipynb`: investigates the computation of error bars with the bootstrap approach.
- `ranking.ipynb`: investigates the efficiency of the method to compute the probabilities of the variables being the most informative and compares with the Monte-Carlo approach .
